****Subject:****

This project was carried out in C# ASP .NET. It aims to simulate the universe that surrounds us by managing celestic objects such as comets, constellations, satellite ,planete and many other celeste objects. 

****Technical specificity:*****

All this comes from two separate APIs, also created by myself, one for authentication and the other for celeste objects.
Communication to the SQLServer database was achieved through the Entity Framework. The front end is composed of Page Razor (cshtml) and JavaScript.
